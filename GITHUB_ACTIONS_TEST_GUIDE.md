# GitHub Actions Testing Guide üîÑ

## Quick Start: Test GitHub Actions in 5 Minutes

### Step 1: Push Your Code to GitHub

```bash
cd "D:\Study Materials\UniSyd\Model Based Software Engineering\stage 2"

# Initialize git (if not already done)
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Add CI/CD pipeline with Docker"

# Add your GitHub repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git

# Push to main branch
git push -u origin main
```

---

### Step 2: View Workflow Runs

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click the **"Actions"** tab
3. You'll see workflows running automatically:
   - ‚úÖ **Frontend CI** (if frontend files changed)
   - ‚úÖ **Backend CI** (if server files changed)
   - üö´ **Deploy to Fly.io** (skipped until you add FLY_API_TOKEN)

---

### Step 3: Check Workflow Status

#### ‚úÖ Successful Run
```
Frontend CI    ‚úì Build and Test (3m 24s)
                ‚úì Docker Build Test (2m 15s)

Backend CI     ‚úì Build and Test (Node 18.x) (4m 12s)
                ‚úì Build and Test (Node 20.x) (4m 08s)
                ‚úì Docker Build Test (3m 45s)
                ‚úì Security Scan (0m 42s)
```

#### ‚ùå Failed Run
Click the failed workflow ‚Üí Click the failed job ‚Üí View logs to debug

## üß™ Testing Without Pushing (Local Act)

You can test GitHub Actions locally using **Act**:

### Install Act

**Windows (using Chocolatey)**:
```bash
choco install act-cli
```

**Windows (using Scoop)**:
```bash
scoop install act
```

**Manual Download**:
https://github.com/nektos/act/releases

### Run Workflows Locally

```bash
# Test frontend CI
act -W .github/workflows/frontend-ci.yml

# Test backend CI
act -W .github/workflows/backend-ci.yml

# Test all workflows
act
```

**Note**: Act requires Docker Desktop to be running.

## üìã Test Checklist

### Before Pushing

- [ ] Docker builds succeed locally (`docker-compose up --build`)
- [ ] Frontend accessible at http://localhost:80
- [ ] Backend accessible at http://localhost:3001
- [ ] Health check returns 200 (`http://localhost:3001/health`)
- [ ] No TypeScript errors (`cd server && npm run build`)
- [ ] No linting errors (`cd frontend && npm run lint`)

### After Pushing

- [ ] All workflows appear in Actions tab
- [ ] Frontend CI passes (green checkmark)
- [ ] Backend CI passes (green checkmark)
- [ ] No failed jobs
- [ ] Build artifacts uploaded successfully

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Workflow Not Triggering

**Cause**: Workflow file not in correct location

**Solution**:
```bash
# Ensure workflows are in .github/workflows/
ls .github/workflows/

# Should see:
# frontend-ci.yml
# backend-ci.yml
# deploy-fly.yml
```

### Issue 2: Build Fails on GitHub but Works Locally

**Cause**: Missing dependencies or environment differences

**Solution**:
1. Check workflow logs for specific error
2. Ensure `package-lock.json` is committed
3. Verify Node version matches (18.x)
4. Check Prisma schema is committed

### Issue 3: Docker Build Fails in CI

**Cause**: Out of memory or timeout

**Solution**:
- Workflows already configured with caching
- Multi-stage builds minimize size
- If still failing, check Dockerfile syntax

### Issue 4: "FLY_API_TOKEN not found"

**Cause**: Deploy workflow runs but secret not set

**Solution**: Skip deploy until Fly.io is set up (see below)

---

## üìä Understanding Workflow Results

### Build Artifacts

After successful runs, download artifacts:

1. Go to workflow run
2. Scroll to "Artifacts" section
3. Download:
   - `frontend-build` (built frontend)
   - `backend-build` (compiled TypeScript)

### Job Summary

Each workflow provides a summary:
- Node version used
- Branch name
- Commit SHA
- Build status

---

## üéØ Manual Trigger

You can manually trigger the deploy workflow:

1. Go to **Actions** tab
2. Click **"Deploy to Fly.io"**
3. Click **"Run workflow"** dropdown
4. Select branch
5. Click **"Run workflow"** button

---

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

Your CI is working correctly when:

- [x] All workflows show green checkmarks
- [x] Build time < 10 minutes
- [x] No failed jobs
- [x] Artifacts uploaded successfully
- [x] Security scan shows no critical vulnerabilities

---

## üìù Next Steps

Once GitHub Actions are working:
1. Set up Fly.io (see [FLY_IO_TEST_GUIDE.md](./FLY_IO_TEST_GUIDE.md))
2. Add `FLY_API_TOKEN` to GitHub Secrets
3. Push to main ‚Üí Automatic deployment! üöÄ

**Status**: Ready to test GitHub Actions ‚úÖ  
**Time to First Test**: ~5 minutes  
**Prerequisites**: GitHub account, repository created
