## 🤖 Testing AI Features

### AI-Powered Note Summary

When a caregiver adds a note, the backend calls OpenAI to generate a summary:

**Input Note**:
```
Patient had a great day today. Took all medications on time, 
went for a 30-minute walk in the garden, and had a video call 
with family. Mood seems significantly improved compared to yesterday.
```

**Expected AI Summary** (example):
```
"Patient showed improved mood, completed all meds, and enjoyed family time."
```

### AI Health Summary (Doctor Dashboard)

When doctor selects a patient, `/api/ai/summary/:patientId` generates:

**Expected Output**:
```
"John has maintained 90% medication adherence this week. 
Recent mood indicators show positive engagement. No emergency 
alerts in the past 7 days. Overall health trajectory is stable."
```
